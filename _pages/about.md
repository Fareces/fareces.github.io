I’m a fourth-year PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I joined the program in autumn 2022 and am fortunate to be advised by Professor John Duchi, working on uncertainty quantification for reliable machine learning.

I grew up in Buenos Aires :argentina: and moved to California in 2018 to pursue a B.S. in Electrical Engineering at UCLA. During that time, I had the opportunity to join Professor Richard Wesel's Communications Systems Laboratory (CSL), which sparked my interest in information theory and statistics. My work at UCLA focused on characterizing the fundamental limits of communication systems and using these insights to design improved communication protocols.

At Stanford, my research builds on this foundation, as I develop methods for uncertainty quantification in machine learning. My goal is to understand both the theoretical limits and practical possibilities of reliable predictions. I have focused on techniques like conformal prediction and calibration in both offline and adversarial online settings, and I've recently begun exploring safe and principled reinforcement learning for large language models.

I’m passionate about translating theoretical insights into practical tools that bring provable reliability to machine learning systems. If you're working on related problems or are simply curious, I’d love to connect, chat, or collaborate—feel free to reach out!
